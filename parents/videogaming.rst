Thoughts on video gaming
========================

Video gaming has great benefits for children in a modern society.  Good games, with good interactions can lead to examples such as minecraft here ::

  The game encourages a host of positive and prosocial behaviors. We’ve watched our kids   
  gather with their friends time and time again and, in the course of playing together, 
  dedicating time to planning what they will build, measuring out spatial relations and  
  quantities of resources, dividing labor, and otherwise actively working together to 
  build whatever the project of the day is. When the kids aren’t actively playing 
  Minecraft they’re talking about it, sharing Minecraft articles with each other, and 
  voraciously reading those articles to learn more about Minecraft.

I agree with those sentiments, but this is on an excellent and widely respected game, and I suspect with strong parental guidance and peer support.  These things are of course essential
